### Oldrelease and Ubuntu Linux 16.04: 1 NOTE

```
  Author field differs from that derived from Authors@R
    Author:    'Robin van Emden [aut, cre] (<https://orcid.org/0000-0001-5820-8638>), Maurits Kaptein [ctb]       (<https://orcid.org/0000-0002-6316-7524>)'

```
The only way to get rid of this is by removing the ORCID from the Authors@R comment field - which is processed correctly in R versions later than oldrelease/Ununtu 16.04. Presume this can safely be ignored.
